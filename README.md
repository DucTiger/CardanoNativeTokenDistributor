# Cardano Native Token Distributor

## Overview
Cardano Native Token Distributor is an open-source module that allows developers to integrate automated, epoch-based native token distribution into their applications. This system ensures efficient token allocation with minimal UTXO congestion and reduced transaction fees. 

## Features
- **Automated Distribution:** Tokens are allocated periodically based on epochs without requiring manual transactions.
- **Low-Cost Claims:** Users only pay minimal transaction fees when claiming their tokens.
- **Franken Address Prevention:** Secure address verification ensures that tokens are claimed by the rightful owner.
- **Developer-Friendly API:** Simple RESTful API for easy integration into dApps, websites, and mobile applications.
- **Open-Source & Modular:** Fully open-source with flexible customization options.

## Benefits
- **Efficient Reward Distribution:** Ensures seamless token rewards similar to Cardano staking rewards.
- **Scalability:** Reduces blockchain congestion by aggregating token claims over multiple epochs.
- **Security:** Utilizes cryptographic proofs to validate wallet ownership.
- **Cost-Effective:** Eliminates unnecessary network fees associated with frequent token transfers.

## Use Cases
1. **Staking & Reward Systems**
   - Projects can distribute staking rewards in native tokens efficiently.
2. **Dividend Payments for DAOs & Companies**
   - Automatically allocate dividends to token holders without manual intervention.
3. **Payroll for Decentralized Teams**
   - Distribute salaries or incentives periodically using smart contracts.
4. **Gaming & NFT Royalties**
   - Reward players, creators, or contributors on a scheduled basis.
5. **Loyalty & Membership Programs**
   - Allocate tokens to users based on participation, engagement, or loyalty milestones.

## Installation
To integrate with your application, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install cardano-native-token-distributor-sdk
```

## Integration Example
```javascript
const TokenDistributor = require('cardano-native-token-distributor-sdk');
const distributor = new TokenDistributor('YOUR_API_KEY');

distributor.claimTokens('addr1q...xyz', 'signed_message', 455)
  .then(response => console.log("Transaction submitted:", response.transaction_id))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
